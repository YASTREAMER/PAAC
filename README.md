# PAAC Project
    Repo for trying out different CNN models.New models will be added soon. The repo uses pytorch as the main framework.

# __Models description__ #

## __Mnist.ipynb__ ##

    The first model uses CNN to achieve an accuracy of:-90.25999999999999%.
    Nothing more will be added to tihs model after this.

## __CIFAR10.ipynb__ ##

    The second model added uses CNN on CIFAR10 dataset the achieves an accuracy of:-80.0%
    The mdoel is a basic CNN model. Nothing more will be added to this model after this.

## __Ad_CNN.ipynb__ ##

    This is the third model on list and uses advance CNN to classify CIFAR10 Dataset.
    The model is yet to be runned and hyperparameter tuning is till left.

##  __AutoencodersCIFAR10.ipynb__ ##

    This python files shows the power of autoencoders. They are very useful as they can compress a given input and thus are very useful for dimensionality reduction. This one uses Convolutional layers to achieve this on the CIFAR10 dataset.
##  __AutoencodersMNSIT.ipynb__ ##

    This python files shows the power of autoencoders. They are very useful as they can compress a given input and thus are very useful for dimensionality reduction. This one uses Linear fully connected layers to achieve this on the MNIST dataset.

## __To DO List__ ##

This is the TO DO LIST of the project

-[X] Run the Advance CNN model 

-[X] Add autoencoders and variational encoder 

-[ ]  Try autoencoders on Galaxy dataset

-[ ] Use autoencoders to reduce the dimension of the dataset and use them to improve performance
